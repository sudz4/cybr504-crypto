    "The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system that addresses the problem of verifying the ownership of a public key in public key cryptography. It is a practical solution that ensures the authenticity of a public key and its claimed owner. This lab aims to give students first-hand experience with PKI by providing a series of tasks that focus on the concept. By completing these tasks, students will gain a deeper understanding of how PKI works and how it is used to protect communications. They will also learn how to create and analyze certificates, the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks and how PKI can defeat them. \n"

    "In this lab, rather than relying on commercial Certificate Authorities (CA) like VeriSign, we will be creating our own digital certificates. We will become a \"root CA\" ourselves and use this CA to issue certificates for servers and other entities. This process is known as self-signing. The root CA's certificate is a special type of certificate that is self-signed and is considered unconditionally trusted by most operating systems, web browsers and other software that rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This task of becoming a root CA and generating a certificate for it is an important step in understanding how digital certificates and PKI work and how we can establish trust in a digital environment without relying on commercial CAs.\n",
