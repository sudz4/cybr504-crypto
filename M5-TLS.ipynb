    "\n",
    "The protection of online communication is a critical concern in today's digital world. One of the most widely-used solutions to this challenge is Transport Layer Security (TLS). This protocol is specifically designed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communications over the Internet. The primary application of TLS is the encryption of communications between web applications and servers, such as when a web browser accesses a website. However, it can also be used to secure other forms of digital communication, such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP).\n",
