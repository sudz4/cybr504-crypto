    "SSH (Secure Socket Shell) is a secure network protocol that enables remote access to a computer or device over the internet. It uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the user, meaning the user must have a unique pair of SSH keys to access the system. The SSH keys serve as the access credentials and are used in place of a password, making the authentication process more secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SSH keys provide access to sensitive resources and perform critical tasks, it is essential to manage them securely, just as you would with any other sensitive credential. Mismanagement or compromise of SSH keys can lead to serious security incidents, such as unauthorized access to sensitive information or data breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSH is widely used in Unix and Linux environments, where it is considered a standard tool for remote access and management. However, it is also supported in Windows systems, providing a secure alternative to traditional remote access methods such as Telnet and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).We start this lab by generating rsa keypairs. There are many tools available to help you generate key pairs. In this lab we will start with ssh-keygen. It is available on Linux, Mac and Windows."
